    </H2>
    <P>Paragraph writing has been a part of
      the writing process in every student’s life.
      Not only for any examination but also in our
      personal lives, we will need to write about
      different topics. Paragraph writing is a
      simple process, and yet it needs special
      attention as you have to be short, precise
      and to the point. </P>

      <P> <b>While William Shakespeare’s</b>
        reputation is based primarily on his plays, he became famous <strong>first</strong> as a poet. With the partial
        exception of the Sonnets (1609), quarried since the early 19th century for autobiographical secrets allegedly
        encoded in them, the nondramatic writings have traditionally been pushed to the margins of the Shakespeare
        industry. Yet the study of his nondramatic poetry can illuminate Shakespeare’s activities as a poet emphatically
        of his own age, especially in the period of extraordinary literary ferment in the last ten or
        twelve years of the reign of <em>Queen Elizabeth.</em> </P>
