<H2>OBJECTIVE
</H2>
<P>Paragraph writing has been a part of
the writing process in every studentâ€™s life.
 Not only for any examination but also in our
  personal lives, we will need to write about 
  different topics. Paragraph writing is a 
  simple process, and yet it needs special 
  attention as you have to be short, precise
   and to the point. </P>
